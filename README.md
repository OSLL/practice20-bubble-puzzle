# AndroidGithubCiTemplate

![Android CI](https://github.com/Makentoshe/AndroidGithubCiTemplate/workflows/Android%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a template android project with a configured Github CI workflow.
Before using make sure the project packages were changed in the manifest, gradle.build, and in code files.

_Important_: "code files" includes tests, so the path app/src/androidTest/java/com/makentoshe/androidgithubcitemplate/ also counts.
